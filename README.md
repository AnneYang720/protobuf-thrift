# protobuf-thrift
Little cli utility for lazy guyðŸ˜‰ ~ Transforming protobuf idl to thrift, and vice versa.

> [IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL)(Interface description language), which is a descriptive language used to define data types and interfaces in a way that is independent of the programming language or operating system/processor platform.

[ä¸­æ–‡æ–‡æ¡£](./docs/cn.md)

## Install
For folks don't have GO development environment, directly download corresponding platform binary from latest release is the best choice.

For Gophers, you can just `go get github.com/YYCoder/protobuf-thrift` and `go build` it yourself.


## Usages

### Basic Usage
Basic thrift file to protobuf file transform:

```
protobuf-thrift -t thrift2proto -i ./path/to/idl.thrift -o ./idl.proto`
```

Basic protobuf file to thrift file transform:

```
protobuf-thrift -t proto2thrift -i ./path/to/idl.thrift -o ./test.proto`
```

### Interactive Usage
You can simply run like `protobuf-thrift -t thrift2proto` and then, paste your original idl file to the terminal and press ctrl+D.

> Note that interactive mode can not use **-r** option, as there is no files, only stdin.

### Case Converting
Protobuf-thrift provides complete case convert feature, thanks to [strcase](https://github.com/iancoleman/strcase), available options already listed in **--help** message.

### Recursive Transforming
Under some circumstances, you may want to transform a whole idl repo to another language, we provide you **-r** option to indicate protobuf-thrift to transform all imported files.

This option is off by default, so you have to specify it explicitly.

```
protobuf-thrift -t thrift2proto -i ./path/to/idl.thrift -o ./idl.proto -r 1`
```

## Caveat

Since protobuf and thrift have many different grammars, we can only transform grammars that have same meaning, e.g. protobuf message => thrift struct, protobuf enum => thrift enum.

Here is a list of transformation rule, so we hope you won't have to worry about protobuf-thrift do sth unexpected.

|protobuf type|thrift type|field type|notice|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|message|struct|optional => optional; repeated T => list\<T\>|only protobuf 2 have optional field|
|map<T1,T2>|map<T1,T2>||T1 only support int32/int64/string/float/double, due to thrift syntax|
|enum|enum|||
|int32|i32|||
|int64|i64|||
|float|double|||
|double|double|||
|bool|bool|||
|string|string|||
|bytes|binary|||
|service|service|rpc => methods||
|constant|const||not support currently|
|package|namespace|||
|import|include|||
|syntax|||only supported in protobuf, so thrift will omit it|
|option|||only supported in protobuf, so thrift will omit it|
|extend|||only supported in protobuf, so thrift will omit it|
|extension|||only supported in protobuf, so thrift will omit it|
